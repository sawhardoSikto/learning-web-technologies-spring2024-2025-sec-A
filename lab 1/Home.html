                    Wind Turbine 
                    Wind power is a renewable form of energy. It is very
                    cost-effective and can be used to perform multiple
                    tasks. Generally, wind turbines are located at higher
                    places or near the sea. Wind turbines are energy
                    efficient and can convert 20 to 40 wind into energy. It is
                    a pollution-free way to generate energy.
                    Volunteer at National STEAM Olympaid
                    I helped to organize that event, Which is a large event
